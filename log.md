# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 1: Monday March 18, 2019

![DAY 1](/img/d001.png)

**Today's Progress**: Started to work on backend (node.js - express) and frontend (vue.js) for the timing part of the TimeTracking app - the database setup and APIs on the server side and on connections and state management on the Frontend side. 00:30-2:30

**Thoughts:** Trying to do express and DB connections without resorting to doc's proves to be a challenge. Also there was a lot of going back and forth between BE<->FE to consolidate data and to finally create a document in the DB. I expect this to be less of an issue as I progress and repeat the steps.

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
