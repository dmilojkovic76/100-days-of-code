# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 1: Monday March 18, 2019

![DAY 1](/img/d001.png)

**Today's Progress:**
Started to work on backend (node.js - express) and frontend (vue.js) for the timing part of the TimeTracking app - the database setup and APIs on the server side and on connections and state management on the Frontend side. 00:30-2:30

**Thoughts:**
Trying to do express and DB connections without resorting to doc's proves to be a challenge. Also there was a lot of going back and forth between BE<->FE to consolidate data and to finally create a document in the DB. I expect this to be less of an issue as I progress and repeat the steps.

## Day 2: Tuesday March 19, 2019

**Today's Progress:**
I started the morning browsing through Medium and found a great read by [Austin Tackaberry](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/@austintackaberry) on [How I went from newbie to Software Engineer in 9 months while working full time](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-i-went-from-newbie-to-software-engineer-in-9-months-while-working-full-time-460bd8485847).
* I did continue with [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) and spent some time there.
* I also started [Harvard's CS50](https://online-learning.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science) course in Computer Science on [edX](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50+X/course/).
* Worked on TimeTracking app - Continue work on DB conectrions on the FrontEnd, state and data management and interactivity.

**Thoughts:**
As Austin said it in his article, and I couldn't agree more, I need to have a goal! So I set my goal to be: __Get a software engineering job within one year with the same or better salary than I am making right now__ . So, for now I will follow his plan and try to find some meetups in my city and start attending them. Also as I had already started [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) some time ago, I will try to include it in my daily routine. Also I think I might go through with taking [Harvard's CS50](https://online-learning.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science) on [edX](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50+X/course/) course as a refresher - since the last time I learned this was a long time ago on colledge in 1998-2000.

## Day 3: Wednesday March 20, 2019

![DAY 3](/img/d003.jpeg)

**Today's Progress:**
* I did continue with [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) and finished the Applied Visual Design Challenges.
* Finished Week 0 and Problem 0 of [cs50x](https://online-learning.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science) on [edX](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50+X/course/)
* Did not have time to work on TimeTracking app but I will double the effort on Day 4.

**Thoughts:**
I am realising this will be dificult on some days as this one was. I was at work and after work meetings 8am-9pm non-stop and I really did not have any more energy to learn and code for an hour+. But I overcame it and did it anyways!!!ðŸ˜£

## Day 4: Thursday March 21, 2019

![DAY 4](/img/d004.png)

**Today's Progress:**
* Continued with [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) for a little bit.
* Workef on TimeTracking app untill 5am. Have to be at work in 4 hours. Huh....ðŸ˜´

**Thoughts:**
I was constantly going back and forth between #backend and #frontend, consolidating #API calls and server responses to make it more unified. I seem to be loosing a lot of time in these scenarios. I incorporated #Vuex store in all active pages, so Logging In, Signing Up, Signing Out, Dashboard and DB to state relations all work. I know this is probably an overkill but it's for practice and learning so...

## Day 5: Friday March 22, 2019

![DAY 5](/img/d005.png)

**Today's Progress:**
* Continued with [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) and finished Applied Accessibility, Responsive Web Design and CSS Flexbox challenges.
* Took Week 1 [CS50x](https://online-learning.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science) on [edX](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x) and preparing for Problem Task 1.
* Implemented bcrypt hashing algorythm in TimeTracking app to store hashed passwords in DB and refactored the code.

**Thoughts:**
I find myself enjoyng [CS50x](https://online-learning.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science) so farðŸ¤“! I cannot say I had the same sensation while I was in college.ðŸ¤”ðŸ˜•
For Authentication and SignUp/LogIn stuff I found that [Coding Garden with CJ](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLNgu_OupwoeESgtab33CCw) videos like [Auth from Scratch](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLM_i0obccy3tfAersmDaq7-WFqvooNOXf), [Auth with Node/Express/Postgres](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7qkTzxk_0I&list=PLM_i0obccy3t3qe805JmyAz5Wnjy2OclO) series can be very usefull. Also [academind](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSJbGtTlrDami-tDGPUV9-w) channel has a lot usefull videos on the topic.
